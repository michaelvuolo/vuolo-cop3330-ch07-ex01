# Chapter 7, Exercises 1, 2, and 3 - Calculator

Based on chapter 7, I have modified the calculator08buggy.cpp to fix compile and runtime errors.


## How to use:

The format of what to enter goes as follows separated by a space or new line (by pressing enter): operator (newline or spacebar) second constant (newline or spacebar) first constant

ex as follows:
"- 9 5" = 5 - 9 = -6
or
"/ 3 9 " = 9 / 3 = 3
